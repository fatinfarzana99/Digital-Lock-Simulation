SEM2306 Lab Assignment: (SU21)

1. Count-Down Timer:
- The two 7-segment displays are used to display the value of the count-down timer. Count values can range from 00 to 99.
- Upon initial power-up, the 7-segment display should display 2 decimal points.
- Count-Down Timer operates in 3 Modes:
   - SET: default mode upon power up; mode is used to set the count-down start value.
   - COUNT-DOWN: timer counts down by one count every 0.5s.
   - STOP: time stops counting.
- SW1 is used to set the initial count down value (SET) or stop the count-down (STOP)
   - Each press SW1 should increment the count-down timer value by 1. When the value reaches 99 (max), it should stay at 99. 
   - While in COUNT-DOWN mode, pressing SW1 once should stop the count down (STOP).
- SW2 is used to start the count-down (COUNT_DOWN mode). 
   - When the count-down values reaches 00, it should stop and stay at 00. It then enters into STOP mode.
- Each count-down display change should be followed by a short buzzer beep.
- Display the Count-Down Timer value & mode on the LCD screen.

2. Temperature & Humidity Values:
- Read and update the temperature & humidity data from the AHT10 module every 5 seconds.
- Display the temperature & humidity values on the TFT LCD screen.

3. Blink the colour LED (any colour) to indicate the program running.
4. Display the System clock speed & Time-from-Start of your programming running (already in the template program).
